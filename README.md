## Installation
To install this application, follow the below instructions:
    - First, you must clone the repository to your machine. This requires Git to be installed on your machine, and to use the `git clone` command from the command line, followed by the HTTP or SSH address for the repository.
    - Second, you must install node.js. This engine runs the application, and can be found [here](https://nodejs.org/en/). This application makes use of version 14.17.1.
    - Third, you must install the modules this application depends upon. To do this you must also use the command line. Type in the command `npm install` to install all dependencies for the project.
    - You have installed the project. If you have any issues, be sure to enter these commands from the directory containing the project.

## Usage
This app requires input using the command line, and has no graphical user interface. If you make any sort of mistake or otherwise wish to change previous answers, you can't. You can use ctrl/command + C to terminate the application and start over. If there are any changes you wish to make that are beyond the scope of this generator, you can always modify the README.md directly after you are finished with the app!

## Contribute
If you wish to contribute to this application's development, here are a few ways you can do so:
-Submit bugs and feature requests
-Review source code changes
-Write code and make pull requests

If you have any other ideas for ways to improve the app, contact me and let me know!

## Tests
If you wish to make sure that contributed code works, I advise testing for unlikely user input. Test what happens if the user attempts to input no or null values. Additionally, make sure to test that data is correctly accumulating in the `answers` object, as most errors in this application will come from mistaken syntax for properties within it.

### Frequently Asked Questions
#### Why make a README generator? READMEs are easy!
While a basic README is quite easy to write up, a detailed README that helps newcomers understand the project is invaluable. This doesn't serve as the be-all, end-all of READMEs of course -- only a jumping-off point.
#### This README should do x. It should do y. Why doesn't it do z?
No doubt everyone has different tolerances and preferences for a quality README. This can be its contents as well as its format. But it's important to remember that this application is meant to save time, and the more elaborate it becomes the longer it will take to create the actual README -- to the point that it might take longer than if you wrote it from scratch yourself! That said, feel free to contribute if you have any ideas for how the application can be improved.
#### I don't know what the command line is, or node, or anything like that. How do I start using this?
Well, this application does involve a certain amount of experience to use in its current form. It is meant for hobbyist, learning and professional developers who want to save a little time; these are people who likely know how to use this application or know how to find out how.
